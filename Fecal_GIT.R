## want to look at just the wild bighorn fecal samples so subsetting for fecal and wild

View(fecal_wild_bighorn)  ##not letting me view for some reason

t.test(fecal_wild_bighorn$P~fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON)  ##t-test of Phosporus between pre and post season

mean(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "Post"])  ##mean post

mean(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "pre"])  ## mean pre

sd(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "Post"])  ## st. dev post

### try to write a function so can do all minerals quickly

fecal_ttest <- function(mineral, dat = fecal_wild_bighorn)  {
  mean_pre  <- mean(dat[dat$SEASON == "pre", mineral])
  return(mean_pre)
}

fecal_ttest(mineral = "K")

  sqrt(length(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "pre"]))

boxplot(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "Post"],
        (fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "pre"]))

### how to make bar plots with SE bars???
barplot(mean(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "Post"]),
        mean(fecal_wild_bighorn$P[fecal_wild_bighorn$SEASON == "pre"]))
